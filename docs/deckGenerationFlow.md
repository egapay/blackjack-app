# Deck Generation
- Frontend calls backend to start game session
- Backend starts session by creating game ID and generating deck ID

## DeckId 
    const deck = [
        {
            'spades': [
                { value: 1, played: 0 },
                { value: 2, played: 0 },
                { value: 3, played: 0 },
                { value: 4, played: 0 },
                { value: 5, played: 0 },
                { value: 6, played: 0 },
                { value: 7, played: 0 },
                { value: 8, played: 0 },
                { value: 9, played: 0 },
                { value: 10, played: 0 },
                { value: 'J', played: 0 },
                { value: 'Q', played: 0 },
                { value: 'K', played: 0 },
                { value: 'A', played: 0 }
            ]
        },
        {
            'hearts': [
                { value: 1, played: 0 },
                { value: 2, played: 0 },
                { value: 3, played: 0 },
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            'diamonds': [
                { value: 1, played: 0 },
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            'clubs': [
                { value: 1, played: 0 },
                ...
            ]
        },
    ];

  - Generated by creating an list of objects containing cards
  - Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs
  - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

## Drawing a Card
  - Frontend calls **draw** endpoint
  - Server selects suit at random and picks value at random
  - Suit and Value are sent to the front-end while the played counter for respective card gets incremented

## Storage
  - Frontend will store playerId (if applicable) and gameId locally (cookie)
