# Implementation Phase
## Set Up Project Environment

- [ ] Set up GitHub repository.
- [ ] Set up project structure for front end and back end.
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier to enforce coding standards.

## Database Setup

- [ ] Set up MySQL database and create tables based on your schema design.
- [ ] Create migration scripts to manage changes in the database schema.

## Implement Back-End APIs

- [ ] Create Express routes for user management and game actions.

- [ ] **User Dashboard**: Display user statistics and game history.

## State Management and API Integration

- [ ] Use React Context or Redux to handle authentication and game state.
- [ ] Integrate APIs to allow the front end to interact with the back end.

## Testing

- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Test each component and API endpoint.
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test the interactions between the front end and back end.
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Ensure the application functions as expected for end users.

## Deployment

- [ ] Deploy the front end to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
- [ ] Deploy the back end using Heroku or AWS.
- [ ] Database: Use a managed service like AWS RDS for MySQL.

## Documentation

- [ ] Write README for the project.
- [ ] Include API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or similar tools).
- [ ] Document the project structure, how to run the project locally, and any other setup instructions.
